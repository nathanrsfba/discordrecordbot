Discord RecordBot saves recordings in a very simple structured file format.  The file consists of 'blobs', each of which is a chunk of discrete data.

A blob consists of:
 * A 4-byte ASCII signature describing the type of data the blob contains
 * A 4-byte big-endian integer describing the length in bytes of the payload
 * The payload itself, whose length in bytes is exactly the value of the
   previous field

There are several types of data that may be stored in a blob:
 * A zero-length marker; the length is zero and the payload is nonexistent
 * A 32-bit, big-endian integer, signed unless otherwise specified
 * A string, encoded as UTF-8, with no padding or termination bytes
 * Raw binary data

A recording consists of a header, and the body. Each contains a sequential
series of chunks.

The header *shall* contain the following blob types:

DRBT: (marker), indicating the start of the header
RSPS: (int) Audio sample rate
RCHN: (int) Number of channels: 1=mono, 2=stereo

The header *may* contain the following blob types:

RFRS: (int) Frame size (the number of samples in each chunk of audio)
TIME: (int) The start time of the recording, in Unix time
GULD: (str) The name of the server the recording was taken from
CHNL: (str) The name of the channel the recording was taken from
USER: (str) The name of the user of this recorded stream

The body of the recording begins with a marker blob of type DATA.

The body *shall* contain the following blobs:

RPKT: (marker) The start of a packet of audio
STMP: (int) The time the packet was received, measured as milliseconds since
the start of the recording
PCM0: (binary) PCM data in 16-bit format. The sample rate and channels are
given by the information in the header.
